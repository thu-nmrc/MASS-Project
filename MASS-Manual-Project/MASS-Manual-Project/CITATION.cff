abstract: >
  We introduce Multi-Agent Social Simulation (MASS), a language-native experimental framework in which large
  language models (LLMs) act as intersubjective agents. MASS models social processes directly in natural language
  and executes policy shocks in a controllable, round-based environment while recording both numeric actions and
  one-sentence intention rationales. We specify a minimal, sufficient protocol (time granularity, exogenous rules,
  agent autonomy, controlled contrasts, independent replications) and use intention texts to link dialogue chains
  to causal chains for mechanism audits. As a validity and reliability testbed, we revisit the New Jersey–Pennsylvania
  minimum-wage case: across 46 weekly rounds and multiple independent replications, MASS reproduces the classic
  Card–Krueger pattern — post-policy starting wages rise (about $0.65/h), employment effects are statistically
  indistinguishable from zero, and prices move only mildly; a counterfactual group without the wage floor shows no
  such pattern. Keeping a single modeling equation (the conditional language-model objective) anchors outputs in the
  public-language corpus that embodies intersubjectivity. MASS combines experimental control and repeatability with
  language-based coordination and explanation, offering a low-risk platform for ex-ante policy probing and extreme
  counterfactuals in the social sciences.
